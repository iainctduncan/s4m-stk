Welcome to the Scheme For Max Sequencing Toolkit!
=================================================

The S4M Sequencing Toolkit is intended to be a comprehensive resource
for building sequencers and related tools for live-coding, live-performance,
and composition in Scheme For Max.

The first series (and only so far!) is the Step Sequencer Tutorial
series. This includes an e-book(let) tutorial that builds up to a 
live-codable multi-track step sequencer with GUI and midi example controls.

Each step of the tutorial has an accompanying scm and Max file
in the tutorial-code directory.
