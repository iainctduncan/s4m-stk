Welcome to the Scheme For Max Sequencing Toolkit!
=================================================

The S4M Sequencing Toolkit is intended to be a comprehensive resource
for building sequencers and related tools for live-coding, live-performance,
and composition in Scheme For Max.

The first series (and only so far!) is the Step Sequencer Tutorial
series. This includes an e-book(let) tutorial that builds up to a 
live-codable multi-track step sequencer with GUI and midi example controls.

Each step of the tutorial has an accompanying scm and Max file
in the tutorial-code directory.

Read the narrative here: https://iainctduncan.github.io/s4m-stk/

The intention is to add video tutorials for each step of the 
tutorials, but I am publishing them as text first to collect 
feedback prior to making videos.

Please feel free to submit suggestions or error reports in the
issue tracker.
